Generate gitignores from the command line üõ†Ô∏è

* Free software: Apache Software License 2.0

## Project Description

Extremely simple (but very useful) CLI that generates `.gitignore` files from the command line (sort of üòâ). It's a sister project to [goignore], replicated here in
rust ü¶Ä.

### Why?

[goignore] was the first real program I wrote while learning Go, so I thought why not do it in Rust too? Like [goignore] it's mostly a thin wrapper around the
[gitignore API]. The list of things you can pass are documented on [gitignore.io].

## Installation

There are pre-compiled binaries available in the GitHub releases, or there is a homebrew tap available:

```shell
brew install FollowTheProcess/homebrew-tap/ignorers
```

## Quickstart

The binary itself is called `ig` (for `ignorers`), so you can run it like so:

```shell
ig macos python visualstudiocode
```
